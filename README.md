# VidyuthSamraksh
In present existing system of electricity meter reading, a person has to go area by area and take the readings from the energy meter in every house and generate the bill. It is often for errors like extra bill amount, late billing, and notifications from Electricity Department even though the bills are paid. Apart from that people will get to know their usage only after the person comes and takes the reading from the energy meter.

To overcome these problems, we proposed a novel, an IoT based technique called "Vidyuth Samraksh". This framework is divided into three major modules, namely: Arduino UNO with ATMEGA328P Micro Controller, GSM module, and ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. Arduino ATMEGA328P is used here because it is energy efficient i.e., it consumes less power, and it is the fastest. The GSM module provides a feature of sending a notification through an SMS. ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is used to post the data into the cloud. One can view their daily usage that is updated in the "ThingSpeak" Cloud API. This proposed system gives flexibility in monitoring and checking the current readings with cost on the “ThingSpeak” website, and in the "ThingView" App anytime. Users will start receiving the message notifications once the threshold is about to reach.
